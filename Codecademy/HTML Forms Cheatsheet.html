
<!-- Checkbox -->
<!-- When using an HTML input element, the type="checkbox" attribute will render a single checkbox item. To create a group of checkboxes related to the same topic, they should all use the same name attribute. Since it's a checkbox, multiple checkboxes can be selected for the same topic. -->
<input type="checkbox" name="breakfast" value="bacon" id="option-1">
<label for="option-1">Bacon</label><br>

<input type="checkbox" name="breakfast" value="eggs" id="option-2">
<label for="option-2">Eggs</label></br>

<input type="checkbox" name="breakfast" value="pancakes" id="option-3">

<!-- Textarea -->
<!-- The textarea element is used when creating a text-box for multi-line input (e.g. a comment section). The element supports the rows and cols attributes which determine the height and width, respectively, of the element. -->
<!-- When rendered by the browser, textarea fields can be stretched/shrunk in size by the user, but the rows and cols attributes determine the initial size. -->
<!-- Unlike the input element, the <textarea> element has both opening and closing tags. The value of the element is the content in between these tags (much like a <p> element). The code block shows a <textarea> of size 10x30 and with a name of "comment" -->
<textarea rows="10" cols="40" name="comment"></textarea>


<!-- Form Element -->
<!-- The HTML <form> element is used to collect and send information to an external source. -->

	<input type="submit">
</form>

<!-- Number -->
<!-- HTML input elements can be of type number. These input fields allow the user to enter only numbers and a few special characters inside the field. -->

<input type="number" name="balance"><br>

<!-- Input Range Type -->
<!-- A slider can be created using the type="range" attribute on an HTML input element. The range slider will act as a selector between minimum and maximum value. These values are set using the min and max attributes, respectively. The slider can be adjusted to move in different steps or increments using the step attribute. -->
<!-- The range slider is meant to act as a visual widget to adjust between 2 values, where the relative position is important, but the precise value is not as important. An example of this can be adjusting the volume level of an application. -->
<input type="range" name="movie-rating" min="0" max="10" step="0.1"><br>

<!-- Select Element -->
<!-- The HTML <select> element can be used to create a dropdown list. A list of choices for the dropdown list can be created using one or more <option> elements. By default, only one <option> can be selected at a time. -->

<!-- Submitting a Form -->
<!-- Once we have collected information in a form we can send that information somewhere else by using the action and method attribute. The action attribute tells the form to send information. A URL is assigned that determines the recipient of that information. The method attribute tells the form what to do with that information once it's sent. An HTTP verb is assigned to the method attribute that determines the action to be performed. -->

<!-- The list of data is shown as a dropdown on an input field when a user clicks on the input field. As the user starts typing, the list will be updated to show elements that best match what has been typed into the input field. The actual list items are specified as multiple option elements nested inside the datalist. -->
<!-- datalist's are ideal when providing users a list of pre-defined options, but to also allow them to write alternative inputs as well -->
<input type="text" list="ide" name="ide">
<datalist id="ide">
	<option value="Visual Studio Code"></option>
	<option value="Atom"></option>

<input type="submit"><br>

<!-- Input Name Attribute -->
<!-- Note: In roder for a form to send data, it needs to be able to put it into key-value pairs. This is achieved by setting the name attribute of the input element. The name will become the key and the value of the input will become the value the form submits corresponding to the key. -->
<!-- It's important to remember that the name is not the same as the ID in terms of form submission. The ID and the name of the input may be the same, but the value will only be submitted if the name attribute is specified. -->

<input type="text" name="username2" id="username2"><br>
<input id="address"><br>

<!-- Label Element -->
<!-- The HTML <label> element provides identification for a specific input based on matching values of the <input>'s id attribute and the <label>'s for attribute. By default, clicking on the <label> will focus the field of the related <input> -->

<label for="password">Password:</label>
<input type="text" id="password" name="password"><br>

<!-- Input Password Type -->
<!-- The HTML <input> element can have the attribute type="password" that renders a single row input field which allows the user to type censored text inside the field. It is used to type in sensitive information -->

<input type="number" name="number-input" max="11"><br>

<!-- maxlength Attribute -->
<!-- In HTML, input fields with type text have an attribute called maxlength that specifies the maximum number of characters that can be entered into the field. The code block shows an input text field that accepts text that has a maximum length of 140 characters. -->
