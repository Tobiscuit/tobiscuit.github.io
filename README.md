## Coding Journey
Hello, world! As a former Computer Information Systems student, I realized my interest belonged to Computer Science. During my time at college, I hadn't developed the social skills to succeed and I now understand how to improve by communicating with my peers. Setting myself up for success is imperative, so this GitHub repo will serve as progress I can look back on to measure my progress, as well as demonstrate proficiency to prospective employers.
Excited and looking forward to providing information solutions to companies through web development!

Started The Complete Web Developer in 2020 by Andrei Neagoie  
Went over high level overview of networking, how the web works, and tried out a new IDE! 

**05/11/2020**  
Finished Learning to Learn!  
There are so many techniques I've learned about and it's eye opening how unproductive I've been compared to what I can now be. Divide and conquer the problem into small chunks with spaced repetition and pomodoro techniques following Parkinson's Law and the pareto principle I'm excited for the future!!!

**05/10/2020**  
Learning to Learn:
* Systems build habits, and habits are energy-savers.
* The _Pareto Principle_ is all about selecting the most critical topics and removing the unnecessary noise. To be a master at something one must be in the top 5%.
* The forgetting curve and spaced repetition. Our mind is like a muscle and can be trained for efficient learning.

**05/08/2020**  
Learning To Learn:  
* Found out about Anki, a cross-platform open-source flashcard application. I've started to create flashcards for all the subjects I'm studying.  
* Learned about S.M.A.R.T. goals and how it helps me achieve anything I set my mind to. (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-Bound). I created a Google Docs detailing everything, and I'm going to print it and hang it on my door! :D  
* Reviewed React notes I've taken from The React Handbook by Flavio Copes

**05/06/2020**  
The last couple of days have been great! I got accepted to **_Zero To Mastery Academy_** taught by **_Andrei Neagoie_**  
Currently taking Learning How To Learn, perhaps I'll write notes here or create a medium account! :D

**05/02/2020**  
Explored my available resources:  
* CodeCademy Pro  
* Frontend Masters  
* ZeroToMastery.io  
* Conquering Responsive Design by Kevin Powell
Now that I've got access to several high quality learning resources, I must be much more ambitious.  
I'm struggling with some health issues but I must push myself with compassion

Course on Pluralsight by Paul D. Sheriff

**04/15/2020**  
Finished freeCodeCamp's  Basic Algorithm Scripting  
Reviewed JavaScript notes  
Starting React - The Complete Guide in a few days  
Thoughts:  
Reading a book on a subject (React), then taking a video course seems to be my preference?

**04/12/2020**  

**04/11/2020**  
Continued Objects, Classes, and Prototypes by Jim Cooper on Pluralsight. This is an advanced JavaScript topic and there's many times I pause and take notes, so the course length is deceiving. Understanding the material is much better than _finishing_ the course.

**04/10/2020**  
Struggled throughout the Basic Algorithms section of freeCodeCamp, so I'm going through and making sure I understand them. I don't yet feel ready for Intermediate Algorithms and I want to be as prepared as possible. Watched and coded along to Objects, Classes, and Prototypes on Pluralsight.

**04/09/2020**  
Continuing the road to becoming a well rounded front-end developer. Solved a couple of freeCodeCamp algorithm problems and continued my SQL Basics course.

**04/08/2020**
Took a dive into the intricacies of the JavaScript engine, explored:
* Callstack
* Event Loop
* Microtask Queue
* Global Memory (the Heap)
* Synchronous vs Asynchronous

**04/07/2020**
Went over the freeCodeCamp algorithm problems I've done so far, and watched:  
* HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: The Big Picture by Barry Luijbregts
* Python: The Big Picture by Jason Olson

**04/06/2020**
Currently stuck on a freeCodeCamp algorithm problem, so I began courses on Frontend Masters. I'm pleasantly surprised at the quality of FE courses. The GitHub student pack has given me access to quality education. I've been thinking: are algorithms and data structures essential for a _front-end_ developer? Doesn't hurt to learn them I suppose...


**04/05/2020**
Continued freeCodeCamp's JavaScript Data Structures and Algorithms curriculum, continued taking notes on Flavio Cope's React Handbook. Self-reflection: is it a good idea to be learning React, Node, and JavaScript all at the same time? Probably not, but to be fair I've finished a 52.5 hour course on JavaScript and read several books already. Trying to perfect my craft, is all.


**04/04/2020**  
LearnSQL.com is giving access to its courses free up until 4/20. To become a well rounded front-end developer, I want to cover as much backend as possible when given opportunities like these. Progress on their SQL Basics course is great, should be finished by tomorrow.
