## Coding Journey
Hello, world! As a former Computer Information Systems student, I realized my interest belonged to Computer Science. During my time at college, I hadn't developed the social skills to succeed and I now understand how to improve by communicating with my peers. Setting myself up for success is imperative, so this GitHub repo will serve as a log so I can look back on to measure my progress, as well as demonstrate proficiency to prospective employers.
Excited and looking forward to providing information solutions to companies through web development!

* ⌛ React docs (continued)
* "If you imagine a component tree as a waterfall of props, each component's state is like an additional water source that joins it at an arbitrary point but also flows down" 

**08/19/2020**
* MemoStarted note taking React's docs, in preparation for ZTM's React course
* Neat security feature: using JSX prevents XSS (cross-site scripting) attacks by converting embedded values to strings

**08/18/2020**
* React Documentation - Main Concepts
  * Lists and Keys
  * Forms (in progress)

> Might need to take notes for retention instead of following along

**08/17/2020**
* React Documentation - Main Concepts:
  * State and Lifecycle
  * Handling Events
  * Conditional Rendering
  * HourglassCurrently on Lists and Keys

**08/15/2020**
* The course covers React basics & immediately wants to jump into building a huge e-commerce website
* Taking a detour & going through the official React documentation's "Main Concepts"

**08/14/2020**
* React allows us to build websites like lego blocks (as components)
* Went over the three stages of a component: mounting, updating, & unmounting
*  Explored lifecycle methods, which are fundamental in structuring our code

**08/13/2020**
* 1st image shows manual binding of user-defined methods in class constructor. Necessary for 'this' to point to correct context
* 2nd image demonstrates arrow functions automatically get lexical scope, thus no manual binding necessary

**08/12/2020**
* Environment set-up for the course: this time we're using Vs Code
* Learned about the benefits of CRA: it takes care of Webpack + Babel configuration
* Currently working through the React Basics section

**08/11/2020**
* Started #ZTM: The Complete React Developer in 2020, a 40+ hour-course
* Advantages of #React involve its declarative nature, where we build reusable components by telling React exactly what  needs to be built through JSX.

**08/10/2020**  
ZTM has provided a lot of support, resources, & community.  
@AndreiNeagoie & people I've met in tech-Twitter have been role models, lifting each other up.  
I wouldn't have been able to do this w/o support from friends, family, & the #100DaysOfCode botzFace with tears of joy

**07/02/2020**  
* Going to start doing Codecademy's Web Developer path out of order to prioritize my weakest subjects, since my pro membership ends in less than a week.
* Going through their Interactive JavaScript Website module, and getting a good refresher on the DOM.

**06/30/2020**  
* The optional JavaScript logic problems were too complex to solve, heck, they were too complex to read and understand the solutions.
* I printed out the solution to one of the problems and annotating step-by-step what each line did. I have a much better understanding, but it can be better. I will go into work early so I have ample time to review the code.

**06/28/2020**  
* Created an concept map for Front End Libraries by freeCodeCamp - there is so much to cover
* Continued reviewing CSS Grid + Flex, and reviewed the first chapter of You Don't Know JS Yet: Get Started
* I'm halfway (50%) through Web Development: Zero to Mastery, but I'm taking time to digest what I've been learning. Specifically the optional JS Logic problems at the end of the Advanced JS section, they're still difficult for me to grasp.

**06/27/2020**  
* Reviewed CSS Grid + Flexbox

**06/25/2020**  
* Read a freeCodeCamp article on .slice(), .splice(), and .split()
* Tried to do the Advanced JavaScript optional challenges from the course but had to look at the solutions. Still trying to reverse-engineer and understand the code

**06/24/2020**  
* Read [A Deep Dive Into JS Modules](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/03/es-modules-a-cartoon-deep-dive/)
* How we organize our code impacts our maintainability. Scope helps us limit ourselves to think about few variables at a time, dividing problems into chunks.
* For example, the library jQuery would put an object with methods on an upper scope, the global scope, but this leads to some problems.
* The programming pattern mentioned above requires us to put our script tags in the right order, and changing the order or deleting a file can throw an error and completely halt our program. Maintaining code is tricky, because the dependencies beteween different parts of our code are implicit, so we don't know which functions depend on which scripts.
* Modules groups functions and variables together and we create explicit relationships thorugh 'import/export' statements
* Read a freeCodeCamp article: [How To Think Like a Programmer](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-think-like-a-programmer-lessons-in-problem-solving-d1d8bf1de7d2/)

**06/23/2020**  
* Reading [A Brief History of JavaScript Modules](https://medium.com/sungthecoder/javascript-module-module-loader-module-bundler-es6-module-confused-yet-6343510e7bde) though struggling to follow the code. It has components of functional programming, an iteratee? The way scope is being used? It's fascinating, and it's helping me understand other languages.

**06/22/2020**  
* Reading a [detailed article on scope by Hammad Ahmed](https://scotch.io/tutorials/understanding-scope-in-javascript#toc-what-is-scope-)
* Still trying to grasp for..in and for..of, more review but there's so much to remember. There must be a way to think of this intuitively. Oh - and asynchronous code, my head is spinning T.T

**06/21/2020**  
* Introduction to asynchronous code in JavaScript and reviewed advanced loops

**06/20/2020**  
* Struggled with for..in and for..of loops. Bottom line:  for..in are for enumerables (objects and arrays), while for..of is great for iterables (arrays and strings).
* The exercises for ES10 (ES2019) were difficult. Specifically, creating functions to find the largest number, I had tor resort to using the spread operator. Which isn't bad, but I want to be able to solve problems in different ways.

**06/19/2020**
* Review day

**06/18/2020**  
* ZTM: The Complete Web Developer (47%)
* In the course, Andrei talked about type coercion (review) but I learned something today: Object.keys(), Object.values(), and Object.entries().
* These methods are something I've used and encountered before, but didn't fully understand it the first time around... or the second... or the third... I'm going to keep on reviewing tonight, I should be able to remember the syntax.
* Completing exercises on my own in this second JavaScript course has been rewarding. All exercises will be uploaded to GitHub at the end of the course.

**06/17/2020**  
* ZTM: The Complete Web Developer - I was wrong, it turns out I'm ahead of my classmates. Following Parkinson's Law, I am setting the deadline of the end of the month to finish the course. This is a daunting challenge.
* Explored advanced arrays, advanced objects, and was once again able to finish the exercises without looking at the solutions. Problem solving is becoming natural for this topic, and I was able to use array methods without looking at documentation.

**06/16/2020**  
* ZTM: The Complete Web Developer - Finished the JavaScript DOM section, and started Advanced JavaScript
* Since I've already finished a 52+ hour course on JavaScript, most of this was refresher: ES5 vs ES6 variable declaration (var vs let/const) and the differing scopes. Object destructuring, ternary operator, switch statement, and touched upon currying and composition.
* The todo list app from yesterday is postponed until I catch up to my ZTM Study Group!:)

**06/15/2020**  
* The DOM Event exercise called for a todo list app with interactive crossing things out, automatically adding buttons after adding items to the list, and clicking the **_button_** strikes it through or clears it out.
* Although I finished the requirements, I was not able to finish the automatic addition of buttons in the time I alloted for myself. So I decided to code along an elegant todo list app (YouTube).
* Completed the first part by Kevin Powell (HTML + CSS), tomorrow will be the JavaScript portion by Kyle from Web Dev Simplified

**06/14/2020**  
* ZTM: The Complete Web Developer (in progress)
* Created the classic To-do List app, added form validation, event listeners for keypress, and went above and beyond by styling it. I definitely want to create a well designed todo list app for personal use with browser storage or SQLite.
* Going to continue Codecademy: Web Developer path and call it a day! :)

**06/13/2020**  
* ZTM: The Complete Web Develper (38%)
* Codecademy: Web Developer Career Path - HTML Tables
* Solidified JavaScript concepts, started learning about the DOM, and using Codecademy to freeflow work on projects. For example, I'm getting all elements with a <td> tag using JS, their textContent, and trying to tally up the total and dynamically display it using JS. It's difficult, but I'm becoming confident in solving problems like these. I'm excited as to what I'll learn tomorrow.

**06/12/2020**  
* Continued ZTM: The Complete Web Developer
* Learned about functions, arrays, and objects, which is nothing new but learning through different resources solified the concepts.
* Finished several exercises without a single sweat, which differs from when I took JavaScript 2020 by Maximilian Schwarzmuller earlier this year. The first time I was learning JavaScript I struggled **_a lot_**

**06/11/2020**  
* The HTML Handbook by Flavio Copes (100%)

Finished Learning to Learn!  
There are so many techniques I've learned about and it's eye opening how unproductive I've been compared to what I can now be. Divide and conquer the problem into small chunks with spaced repetition and pomodoro techniques following Parkinson's Law and the pareto principle I'm excited for the future!!!

**05/10/2020**  
Learning to Learn:
* Systems build habits, and habits are energy-savers.
* The _Pareto Principle_ is all about selecting the most critical topics and removing the unnecessary noise. To be a master at something one must be in the top 5%.
* The forgetting curve and spaced repetition. Our mind is like a muscle and can be trained for efficient learning.

**05/08/2020**  
Learning To Learn:  
* Found out about Anki, a cross-platform open-source flashcard application. I've started to create flashcards for all the subjects I'm studying.  
* Learned about S.M.A.R.T. goals and how it helps me achieve anything I set my mind to. (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-Bound). I created a Google Docs detailing everything, and I'm going to print it and hang it on my door! :D

**04/10/2020**  
Struggled throughout the Basic Algorithms section of freeCodeCamp, so I'm going through and making sure I understand them. I don't yet feel ready for Intermediate Algorithms and I want to be as prepared as possible. Watched and coded along to Objects, Classes, and Prototypes on Pluralsight.

* Python: The Big Picture by Jason Olson

**04/06/2020**
Currently stuck on a freeCodeCamp algorithm problem, so I began courses on Frontend Masters. I'm pleasantly surprised at the quality of FE courses. The GitHub student pack has given me access to quality education. I've been thinking: are algorithms and data structures essential for a _front-end_ developer? Doesn't hurt to learn them I suppose...


**04/05/2020**
Continued freeCodeCamp's JavaScript Data Structures and Algorithms curriculum, continued taking notes on Flavio Cope's React Handbook. Self-reflection: is it a good idea to be learning React, Node, and JavaScript all at the same time? Probably not, but to be fair I've finished a 52.5 hour course on JavaScript and read several books already. Trying to perfect my craft, is all.


**04/04/2020**  
LearnSQL.com is giving access to its courses free up until 4/20. To become a well rounded front-end developer, I want to cover as much backend as possible when given opportunities like these. Progress on their SQL Basics course is great, should be finished by tomorrow.
