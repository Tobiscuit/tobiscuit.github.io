## Coding Journey
Hello, world! As a former Computer Information Systems student, I realized my interest belonged to Computer Science. During my time at college, I hadn't developed the social skills to succeed and I now understand how to improve by communicating with my peers. Setting myself up for success is imperative, so this GitHub repo will serve as progress I can look back on to measure my progress, as well as demonstrate proficiency to prospective employers.
Excited and looking forward to providing information solutions to companies through web development!
















## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Tobiscuit/tobiscuit.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2

2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Tobiscuit/tobiscuit.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
